# Description of Files

- `AlphaMap.h` : Contains the English Alphabets for putting on the image
- `Word.h` : Contains the Word Class that does most of the work, including putting up the whole image and inserting to the file.
- `main.cpp` : Contains the `main()` function. Use this to compile. Depends on the other `.cpp` and `.h` files to compile.
- `Readme.md` : The File you are reading right now.

# Qualification Task for Summer Internship 2019
1. Good problem solving skills:

The Problem has been solved as required, without any prior knowledge of PPM Files.

2. Good programming practices:

The Programming Practices taught in past courses and the ones seen on StackOverflow were used.

3. Good object oriented programming practices:

Same as 2

4. Good object oriented programming practices in C++:

Same as 2

5. Familiarity with updated features of C++:

Although I am quite familiar with them such as STL, Boost and Templates, I still used primitive types for maximum compatibility with older C++ versions and lower overhead.

6. Ability to perform research:

Studied the PPM and PBM File Format thoroughly to understand it completely.

7. Ability to read, understand, and follow technical documentation:

Technical Documentation was followed and understood for usage of PPM Files.

8. Persistence:

Despite some initial difficulties due to not been programming in C++ in a long time and internet connectivity issues, I still managed to complete the task in almost 3 to 3.5 hours.

9. Ability to exercise good judgment in the absence of specific instructions:

Faced a confusion whether "CommandLine Input" meant keyboard input or CMD Arguments, went with the more user friendly way.

10. Reliability:

Tested code for different string combinations with handling for most of them. Also, I use TABs.


11. Familiarity with code collaboration, e.g. through GitHub:

I use git CLI for pushing commits and adding differences to repos. I have collaborated on other GitHub projects as well.

12. Organization:

Structured the Classes in Separate Files with lesser number of files to minimize hassle.

13. Self-motivation:

I like to learn and build new stuff, that is why I spent more time than I would normally 

require exploring more about PPM Files and Image Generation from Code.

14. Ingenuity and resourcefulness:

Almost 90% to 95% of the main image producing code is written from scratch. I mostly consult C++ Documentation for trying out new functions.

15. A good sense of aesthetic:

Generated the Alphabets using a python file in the repository. The Colors can be changed from the code according to one's own aesthetic.

16. Working confidently in a state of uncertainty:

Same Answer as 9

## A Few Notes
- NetPBM was used for converting plain PPM to PNG format, as I don't have software for opening PPM Files. Image Magick can also be used for conversion.
- C++11 was used, although this should work in older versions too, but with a few warnings.
- GNU G++ Compiler was used. MS VC++ may need some changes or other workarounds to compile.

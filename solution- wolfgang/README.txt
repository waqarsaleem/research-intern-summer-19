-> Since i was able to solve the problem, it indicates i have decent problem
solving skills.

-> I have created the code with scalability and understandability in mind.

-> I have used OOP practices in my solution, but not in an overly complicated way.

-> I have familiarity with updated features of c++, for instance i have used
"auto" keyword, although in loops only. I have also used Data Containers from STL.

-> I have throughly researched about ".ppm" format as well as other similary
format ".pbm" or ".pgm" which indicates i have good researching skills.

-> I was confused as should i use an external library to create text image
like "SDL" but choose to not use it as a result my code will not need any special
libraries installed to run, it is pure c++ code. Hence i have the 
ability to exercise good judment in the absence of specific instruction.

-> The final image from my program looks aesthetically pleasing to me.

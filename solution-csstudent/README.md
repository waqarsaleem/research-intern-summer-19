I used the programming practices learnt in OOP (classes) to develop my solution.  
I researched a lot on PPM images and read the documentation, as I did not have any prior knowledge regarding the topic.  
I tried to make my code as organized as possible by inserting comments and using meaningful variablel and function names.  
I was motivated to do this task even though it took me quite some time to do it!  
Aesthetics can be improved by changing colors or fonts, I made separate functions to set font color and background color.
